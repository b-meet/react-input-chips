# React-input-chips

A package with minimum dependencies and maximum customization.

If you want an input field whose value converts to a customizable chip on a click of keys of your choice then this is the best package for you.

You have full control over

-   validation of the field
-   styling of the chips
-   styling of the wrapper
-   chip conversion trigger

## Demo
![react-chips](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba33d40e-63ea-46fa-8011-d418ea211a0a)


## Installation

Install react-input-chips with npm

```bash
  npm install react-input-chips
```


## Usage/Examples

You just need to import the `<InputChip/>` component in the file you want the **react-input-chip** in and pass the required props that's it. All set!

**One important thing** for the default styling of the `<InputChip/>` is that you need to explicitly add CSS file import in the parent or higher or same component. 
The following is the path to it

```bash
import "../node_modules/react-input-chip-beta/dist/index.css";
```


```javascript
import { useState } from "react";
import { InputChips } from "react-input-chip-beta";

const MyComponent = () => {
	const [chips, setChips] = useState<string[]>([]);
	const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");

	return (
		<InputChips
			chips={chips}
			inputValue={inputValue}
			setChips={setChips}
			setInputValue={setInputValue}
		/>
	);
};

export default MyComponent;


```



## Props and information

## Why Beta

Hey guys, 

It is the first npm package I ever released and it's gonna be so much fun I guess. No worries, The supported props and initial version might not have any issues still, incase you face any please open an issue or discussion, a PR for a fix would be much appreciated.

It's beta cause I have not yet included many features and there is a huge opportunity for many devs to contribute here.
When I release version 1.0.0. It will be officially considered a stable version I believe as there are a lot of new features I am willing to add along the way.

I am excited to get some initial issues and feature requests and will work on them on priority until version 1.0.0 ðŸ˜… also after that hehe.

What do I want to be removed in the stable release?
- The explicit addition of CSS file path
- `needWhiteSpace` removal of this if possible

There are many additions I want which I am working on any suggestion are welcome.
